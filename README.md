# Vertigo Games – Data Analyst Case

This repository contains my solutions for the **Vertigo Games Data Analyst Case**.  
I completed both **Task 1 (A/B test simulation)** and **Task 2 (exploratory analysis)**.

The work is split into two folders:

- [`task1/`](task1/): A/B test modeling and revenue simulation in SQL  
- [`task2/`](task2/): Exploratory analysis on user behavior with SQL + Python + Power BI

Each folder has its own `README.md` that explains:

- purpose of the task  
- data and assumptions  
- methodology (SQL / Python pipeline)  
- key findings and conclusions  

Screenshots of key visuals are stored under `task2/images/` and are referenced from the Task 2 README.
